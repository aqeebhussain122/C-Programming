# GNU DEBUGGER NOTES

# GDB Information
GDB is going to be needed in terms of debugging programs which are going through memory leaks and even seg faults. These errors are mainly caused because pointers are referenced in incorrect locations or non-existent areas which is what a NULL Pointer is known as. 

## Correct compilation method
When your code is being compiled in GCC it is vital to add the switch of ``` -ggdb ``` this allows the use of your variable names to be assigned to the values in memory which are known as symbols in gdb. You can then launch gdb successfully with the executable file of your code with all the variables you have in your code file.   

## Safely starting GDB
To make sure you don't get any undefined behaviour when you start your program like nothing happening you should issue the ``` start ``` command. The start command allows a temporary breakpoint added into the start of the program from which you can resume the program further, it has proven to be a more efficient to start a program in GDB.

## If a segmentation fault happens?
If a segmentation fault kicks off (Usually the reason for using GDB) then there's a way of tracing this in gdb. When the seg fault happens you will be informed of the ``` SIGSEGV ``` this means the signal has been given to your program that a segmenation fault has happened. Using the ``` bt ``` command you can issue a backtrace which reverse traces the source of the segmentation fault back to the very line number at which it occured on your file. 

### What is a segmentation fault?
A segmentation fault is when your code tries to access out-of-bounds memory, non-existent memory or memory which is already occupied by a process. The SIGSEGV signal acts as a protection mechanism to prevent your filesystem from getting damaged whilst you develop your code. 

## Command cheat sheet
- gdb (-q -silent -quiet) - Multiple operators we can use to load gdb in a quiet state without displaying disclaimer
- gcc -ggdb (filename) - Compiles the file with the symbols and variables needed to pass it through gdb
- shell command file - Command structure which can be used in the GDB debugger, you don't even need to leave the gdb shell or kill the process
- set logging on|off|redirect - Enables the use of gdb logging into a file for future referencing. 
- gcc display (var) - displays variable as you continiously pass through the program
- clear - Clears all the breakpoints you've set
- breakpoint (number) - Sets up a breakpoint in which the code stops at a certain line when you run it
- checkpoint (number) - recreates the situation in which the code broke
- continue - Good for skipping program logic like loops
- gdb --args <program> <argsâ€¦> Start GDB and pass arguments
- print &(variable) - Prints the memory address of the variable
- step - Useful to step into function stack spaces
- bt - backtrace of the steps of memory it took for the error to occur (Good to isolate functions and fault points)
- info (Object type) - Lists details about the object listed such as breakpoints, functions, display variables. 
  
## ASLR (ADDRESS SPACE LAYER RANDOMINZATION)
Leave the behavior of the started executable unchanged. Some bugs rear their
ugly heads only when the program is loaded at certain addresses. If your bug
disappears when you run the program under gdb, that might be because gdb
by default disables the address randomization on platforms, such as gnu/Linux,
which do that for stand-alone programs. Use set disable-randomization off
to try to reproduce such elusive bugs.
The virtual address space randomization is implemented only on gnu/Linux.
It protects the programs against some kinds of security attacks. In these cases
the attacker needs to know the exact location of a concrete executable code.
Randomizing its location makes it impossible to inject jumps misusing a code
at its expected addresses.

``` ulimit -c unlimited ```

# Core files
A core file or core dump is a file that records the memory image of a running process and its process status (register values etc.). Its primary use is post-mortem debugging of a program that crashed while it ran outside a debugger. A program that crashes automatically produces a core file, unless this feature is disabled by the user. See Files, for information on invoking gdb in the post-mortem debugging mode.

Core files should be used in gdb to recieve details of a seg fault

# Tracing mechanisms

Of course you've got a debugger and the whole point is to stop and resume programs any way you wish. To achieve this there are 3 different kinds of points which can support you
